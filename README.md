KIASORT: Knowledge-Integrated Automated Spike Sorting for Geometry-Free Neuron Tracking

KIASort is a spike sorting platform developed by Kianoush Banaie Boroujeni designed to overcome challenges associated with heterogenous drift patterns, and nonlinear waveform variabilities in high-density neural recordings. KIASort integrates knowledge from channel-specific classifiers trained on clustered sample data. It evaluates channel quality, automatically excludes noisy recordings, and identifies spike classes using a hybrid dimensionality reduction approach combining PCA with nonlinear UMAP embeddings.
Conventional one-dimensional drift correction methods cannot address heterogeneous neuron-specific drift and nonlinear waveform changes. KIASORT geometry-free, per-neuron tracking approach overcomes these limitations without assumptions about cluster shape or probe motion.
The multi-tab graphical user interface (GUI) provides high degree of control over each stage, from initial configuration and channel inspection through detailed clustering analyses and classification performance assessments. Post-sorting, users can easily curate and validate spike sorting quality through advanced visualization tools implemented, including cross-correlograms, inter-spike interval (ISI) histograms, density analyses, similarity detection, and waveform and feature explorations. KIASort is a flexible, user-friendly, and geometry-free spike sorting approach, which can be uses for high density laminar recordings as well as different probe geometry.
